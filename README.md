Aida
====

*** This is only an early first filein of the Aida original code into Cuis 4.1 ***

Port of Aida Web (http://www.aidaweb.si) to Cuis Smalltalk 4.1

Taken from Aida6.5-interim.2 from the repo http://www.smalltalkhub.com/#!/~Aida/Aida/versions/Aida6.5-interim.2


LibAida-Libraries is no longer useful, I used it while porting, to avoid save the big size of data here.
