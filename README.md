Aida
====

Port of Aida Web (http://www.aidaweb.si) to Cuis Smalltalk 4.1

Taken from Aida6.5-interim.2 from the repo http://www.smalltalkhub.com/#!/~Aida/Aida/versions/Aida6.5-interim.2


I split the package to gain a bit of speed while I'm doing the initial port:

LibAida contains the Aida-Libraries of the original (Where I'm having still some problems porting the Amber library).

Aida contains all the Aida code conform I'm porting, without the libraries.
